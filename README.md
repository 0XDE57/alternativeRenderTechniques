A place to keep track of some games or tools that have interesting or unconventional rendering techniques.
Explore different geometries and dimensions. 2D, 3D, 4D, non-euclidean, forced perspective, fractals...
**todo: add more technical breakdown of engines or techniques**


### Anti-Chamber
Antichamber is a mind-bending psychological exploration game where nothing can be taken for granted. Discover an Escher-like world where hallways wrap around upon each other, spaces reconfigure themselves, and accomplishing the impossible may just be the only way forward.



### Stanley Parable
Not super crazy but does uses some teleporting and camera trickery similar to anti-chamber in some parts



### Superliminal
Perception is reality. In this mind-bending first-person puzzler, you escape a surreal dream world through solving impossible puzzles using the ambiguity of depth and perspective.

### A Slower Speed of Light
A Slower Speed of Light is a first-person game in which players navigate a 3D space while picking up orbs that reduce the speed of light in increments. A custom-built, open-source relativistic graphics engine allows the speed of light in the game to approach the player's own maximum walking speed. Visual effects of special relativity gradually become apparent to the player, increasing the challenge of gameplay. These effects, rendered in realtime to vertex accuracy, include the Doppler effect; the searchlight effect; time dilation; Lorentz transformation; and the runtime effect.
